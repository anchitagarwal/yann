*   First and foremost, this toolbox was develoepd largely by adding functionality
    to the amazing `theano tutorials <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/>`_ .
    The theano tutorial today looks much different from what it was when yann was 
    developed on top of it. Although yann looks completely different now being its
    own entity, one can still find some philosophy and structure of the theano
    tutorial code embedded here and there in the toolbox. Therefore enormous 
    credit is due to theano tutorial and theano developers for this toolbox. A lot of 
    developement issues with this toolbox was solved also due to the incredible 
    customer support that was provided by the theano developers at their google groups 
    forum and the issues section of the theano github page.

*   The dropouts part of the code was adapted from Misha Denil's Dropout code.
    The code at the moment does not look at all like the code that Misa Denil 
    originally had, but it was developed from his code and therefore requires
    that due credit be assigned and acknowledgement provided. 
    Refer to license `here <https://github.com/mdenil/dropout/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ .

*   Lasagne played a signnificant role in the developement of yann. Part of the intention
    in begining to develop yann was that Lasagne was getting too large for the 
    authors to keep up. Lasagne therefore insipired some of the aspects of this toolbox. 
    One of the contributors who submitted the rotate layer, used code re-distributed from
    Lasagne toolbox as well. So, in honoring their license, 
    Copyright (c) 2014-2016 Lasagne contributors. 

*   Credit is also due to developers of skdata, progressbar, networkx and developers of 
    all the other dependencies that helping in the creating of this toolbox. Go team OpenSource!
