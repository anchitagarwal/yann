The story behind Yann 
=====================

I am `Ragav Venkatesan`_, the creator of Yann. I started building convolutional neural networks
in early 2015. I began with `theano`_ and started 
following and implementing their tutorials. As I started reading new papers and coding new 
technologies, I slowly integrated them into what was soon developing into a toolbox. My lab mates at
`Visual Representaiton and Processing Group`_ also started getting into CNN research and started 
using my toolbox so I formalized it and hosted it on `GitHub`_. Originally it was a completely 
unstructured and completely demodularized toolbox and went with the name 'samosa'. The original 
codebase still exists in older commits on the git. This toolbox still at its core is still the 
theano tutorials from which it was built.

After considerable effort being put in to make this toolbox modular, and testing it out and after 
using the toolbox on some of my own research. This toolbox, which began as a pet project is 
something that I am now proud to share with the rest of DL community with.

This toolbox is also used with the course `CSE 591`_ at ASU in Spring of 2017. With more features 
being added into the toolbox, I figured I would clean it up, formalize it and write some good 
documentation so that interested people could use it after. Thus after being rechristened as Yann, 
this toolbox was born.

.. warning ::
    
    This is a personal toolbox that I wrote as a project for myself. I promise nothing. Although I 
    try to make sure everything is perfectly working. I encourage anyone to use it, contribute to it
    and write on top of it with that caveat. I still have a lot of code to be written - unittests,
    optimizers, pre-trained models, dataset ports and for all of these I would really appreciate
    contributors and help.

.. tip ::

    I am working on tutorials and quickstart guides for this toolbox. As such, I try to go in detail
    in these tutorials, but I am assuming a pre-requisite training and knowledge on CNNs and 
    Neural Neworks. If you are here looking for a tutorial for those and are disappointed with the 
    material here, please read Prof. Yoshua Bengio's book on Deep Learning, or read the examples 
    from `theano tutorials`_. Theano tutorials also will help understand `theano`_ which is the 
    backend I used for this toolbox. As the course begins, I will add more tutorials with notes that
    will make this more useful and interactive.

What is in the toolbox ? 
========================

This toolbox started with the beautiful `theano tutorials`_. 
The code that is here in yann has the following popular features that all deep net 
toolboxes seem to have. Among many others there are:

+ **CNNs with easy architecture management:** Because layers can take origins as inputs, pretty much
  any architecture that can be drawn on a blackboard can be constructed using this toolbox. 

+ **Dataset handling capabilities:** Features to setup data as simple matlab files 
  that can be loaded in python and run in batches for training. Alternatively, there is also a 
  wrapper to `skdata's`_ dataset interface and future plans for adding the `Fuel`_ interface also.
  As of now, directt ports through ``skdata`` to cifar10, mnist, extended mnists for Hugo Larochelle
  , caltech101, caltech256. More to be added soon.

+ **Data visualization capabilities:** Visualize the activities of select images (or random) from 
  the train set on each layer after select number of epochs of training. Also view filters after 
  select number of epochs. I find this very effective for my understanding.

+ **Techniques from recent publications:** This is where things change a lot and for someone who is 
  getting into deep learning fresh without much theoretical machine learning it would 
  be really helpful. With only a few flags and parameters, one could 
  switch entire optimization methods, including gradient descent, adaGrad, rmsProp add momentums 
  like Polyak Momentum, Nesterov’s accelerated gradients etc. One switch converts the whole networks
  into a max-margin formulation from a softmax formulation. All of these options are plug and play
  or more like add and cook. Most new methods that are recently published 
  and are added including but not limited to: 

   - Dropouts[1]
   - adaGrad[2]
   - Polyak Momentum[3]
   - Nesterov's Accelerated Gradients [4]
   - rmsProp [5]
   - *Adam [8]   
   - Maxout and Mixed out Networks [6]
   - *FitNets and MentorNets[9,15]
   - VGG-19 [10]
   - *Inception Module [11]
   - Batch Normalization [12]
   - ReLU / ELU and other activations supported through theano [13,14]
   - Generative Adversarial Networks [16]

Those marked * are not fully tested yet.
