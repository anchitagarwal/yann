Todo:
    * Something is wrong with the d3viz visualizer for html printing. The path is weird.
    * Visualizer module needs to make use of mathplotlib and print online graphs of outputs of cost
      and possibly display first layer filters for CNNs
    * Datastream should include fuel interface and also needs interface for COCO, PASCAL and
      IMAGENET. Also consider migrating to hd5 for larger datasets ? Should also be able to create
      datasets from images in python. Right now its a roundabout way of going via matlab.
